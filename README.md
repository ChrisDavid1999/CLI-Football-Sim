# CLI-Football-Sim
 Football simulator within command line, not completed
 
 Been a while since I worked on this but enjoyed it a lot
 
 Goals
 - Create a command football simulation that has a few leagues and a larger competion (champions league esc) at the end of a season
 - Load in the team files, making so exiting does not end it all
 - Menu that allows for a new save, and generates names for players and teams randomly from lists of names
 - Players can be traded between teams, and or have random trading algorithms
 - Players have stats/rating of some kind
 - Goals scored and potentially assists to be recorded
 - Pushes player data to csv files which can easily be used in web programs or even just excel to visualise data

 Current State
 - Generate tournaments, teams and players
 - Run through a league of generated teams and players
 - Prints data to txt file

 Next things to get done
 - Look at tournament generation and run through efficiency, make sure its the best implemenation
 - Change txt input and outputs to csv
 - Start a menu, helps to clean out the main function
 - RE NAME PROJECT, console app 1 aint the best name out there....

 One day maybe?
 - IMGUI <3 interface, would look sweet but a lot of work and maybe after the rest of it is done
